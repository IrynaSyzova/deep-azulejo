Requirements: https://github.com/prairie-guy/ai_utilities.git

In this project I want to generate images of Portuguese ceramic tiles, also known as [azulejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo).

Steps:
0. Get data by scrapping google and bing
1. Select usable images from scrapped data: square, symmetric, etc.
2. Enrich sample by manipulating images (cutting, rotating, gluing together).
At this point I already have generated images of tiles unseen before, but I want to experiment further.
3. Using GAN to generate unseen images of tiles
